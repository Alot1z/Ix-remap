// docs.ix-infra.com is meant to hold more than one set of docs — /oss/ now,
// /kartr/ later — so this site builds into dist/oss/ and dist/ is the root of
// the domain. Until there is a page at the root to choose between them, `/`
// redirects to /oss/. It is a 302 so no browser caches it past the day a
// chooser replaces it. The docs' 404 page is copied to the root too, so a
// mistyped URL outside /oss/ still lands on a page with a way back.
