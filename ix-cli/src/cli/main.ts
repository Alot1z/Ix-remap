// temp directory, keyed by file content and Node version, so an upgrade can
// never run stale code; NODE_COMPILE_CACHE moves it and
// NODE_DISABLE_COMPILE_CACHE=1 turns it off. Absent on 22.0: then a no-op.

// before a single line of it runs; the hook's "nothing changed" answer costs a
// git call. So the hook is dispatched here, before that tree is loaded, and
// loads the graph code itself only when there is an edit to report.
// `--help` still goes through the CLI, where the command is documented.
