/**
 * The last `/v1/map` response for a project root, reused by an `ix map` that
 * ingested nothing.
 *
 * `ix map` runs after every agent response (the plugins' Stop hooks), and on
 * a large repo the map request is most of its cost: 4.2 s of 5.7 s on a
 * 30k-file repo where nothing had changed. The backend memoises a scoped map
 * per revision, but still answers slowly, so the only way to skip the cost is
 * to not ask.
 *
 * The response is reused only when every input that decides it is unchanged:
 *
 *   - the graph, by the backend's head revision. Every committed patch in any
 *     workspace advances it, so this is stricter than the map needs, never
 *     laxer: a commit elsewhere costs one extra request, not a stale map.
 *   - the request itself (workspace, `full`), the endpoint, the backend's
 *     release and schema, and this CLI's version.
 *
 * And, decided by the caller, only when this run's ingest wrote nothing
 * (`IngestFilesSummary.graphUnchanged`). The revision alone would miss a
 * workspace whose data was deleted without a commit, which the ingest's
 * DB-reset guard catches.
 *
 * Only a workspace-scoped map is cached. A system-scoped one can change
 * without a commit: the stitcher writes cross-repo edges and stamps system
 * ids directly. So does the unscoped global map, which persists regions as a
 * commit of its own. Both always ask the backend.
