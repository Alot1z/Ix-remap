/**
 * Which root does a bare `ix map` ingest?

 * graph am I querying?", where a configured workspace outranking the current
 * directory is the point. `ix map` writes: it re-ingests a tree and rewrites
 * that workspace's baseline. Letting a configured default outrank the
 * repository the user is standing in means `ix map` inside repo A silently
 * re-ingests repo B, with nothing on screen naming B.
 *
 * So the local answer wins whenever there is one:
 *   1. an explicit path argument
 *   2. the registered workspace containing cwd
 *   3. cwd's own git root  <- ahead of the named/default workspace
 *   4. the named/default workspace, for a cwd with no local context at all
 *   5. cwd

/**
 * Which workspace does `ix ingest <path>` write to?
 *
 * Not simply the path. Treating it as its own root made `ix ingest src/a.ts`
 * inside a mapped repo register `repo/src` as a second workspace, emit
 * `a.ts` instead of `src/a.ts` under that workspace's id, and from then on
 * route every read under `src/` to it. A path is a part of a workspace far
 * more often than it is one, so:
 *
 *   1. an explicit `--root` (the path must be inside it)
 *   2. the registered workspace containing the path
 *   3. the path's git root
 *   4. the path itself for a directory, its directory for a file -- a path
 *      in no workspace and no repository is ingested as its own workspace.
 *
 * The same local-first order as `resolveMapRoot`, minus its named/default
 * workspace step: that one answers "which repo is cwd in", and a path the
 * user named outside every workspace and repository belongs to none of them.
 *
 * A path below the returned root is a partial ingest of that workspace; see
 * `ingestFiles`. Returned canonical (realpath'd), like the path ingest hands in.
