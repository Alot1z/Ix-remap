/**
 * The one-hop tree walk behind `ix trace` (directional modes) and `ix depends`.
 *
 * Both used to recurse depth-first and await each child's whole subtree before
 * starting its sibling, so a walk cost one round trip per expanded node, in
 * series: on the Ix repo's own graph, 1.2-1.8 s of a command whose client work
 * was ~0.1 s. Here the fetching is breadth-first — a node's neighbours are
 * requested the moment the node is discovered, through a bounded limiter — and
 * the tree is built from the fetched lists in a fixed order, so which request
 * returns first never shows in the output.
 *
 * Which tree comes back:
 *
 * - **The walk fits the node cap** (always, when there is no cap). The
 *   breadth-first pass has then fetched every node the old depth-first walk
 *   would expand, and that walk is replayed over the fetched lists. The tree —
 *   shape, child order, dedup, which occurrence of a shared node is expanded
 *   and which is marked `cycle` — and the counters are the old walk's exactly,
 *   except that a cap spent exactly on the last node is no longer reported as
 *   `truncated` when nothing was left to drop.
 *   Replaying matters: breadth-first order would expand a shared node at its
 *   shallowest occurrence, depth-first order at its first one in pre-order.
 *   It has a cost under a depth limit: a node the depth-first walk first met
 *   at the limit, and so never expanded, is fetched anyway when it also sits
 *   shallower. On `ix trace ingestFiles --upstream` that is 20 nodes fetched
 *   for the old walk's 10 — still no slower, the requests being parallel.
 * - **The cap cuts the walk.** The breadth-first tree is returned as it stood
 *   when the cap was reached: every node at depth d is kept before any node at
 *   depth d+1, where the depth-first walk spent the whole budget down its first
 *   branch. `truncated` is set only when a node was actually dropped.
