/**
 * Per-command request sharing for the read paths of `IxClient`.
 *
 * The query commands build their answer from many small reads, and several
 * collectors ask the same question independently: `ix context --from-issue`
 * walks each starting point's neighbourhood with the same helpers, so the
 * files they share are expanded once per starting point -- measured at 56 of
 * 225 requests on one issue against the Ix repository's own graph. Sharing a
 * read by its exact request (method, path, body) removes those without any
 * collector having to know about the others.
 *
 * Scope is one command invocation: `IxClient.shareReads()` is called on the
 * client an action handler creates, and that client is dropped when the
 * command returns. It is never enabled on a long-lived client (`ix watch`, the
 * MCP server), where a read after a write must see the write.
 *
 * What is cached is the response TEXT, not the parsed value: every caller
 * parses its own copy, so a caller that sorts or edits the arrays it was
 * handed cannot change what another caller sees. A miss costs nothing extra --
 * the first caller's parse is the one it always did.
 *
 * A failed read is not kept: every caller waiting on it sees the failure, and
 * the next identical request goes back to the backend, as it did before.
